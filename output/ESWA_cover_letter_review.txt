Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Please consider my manuscript entitled “Machine Learning for Quantitative Trading: Models, Data, Evaluation, and Practical Frontiers” for publication as a Review Article in Expert Systems with Applications.

This survey provides a structured, reusable synthesis of machine learning (ML) for quantitative trading. Beyond summarizing model families (supervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and emerging directions such as large language models), the paper contributes three concrete artifacts designed for direct reuse by ESWA readers: (i) a four-axis task–data–model–evaluation taxonomy to organize the literature along actionable dimensions, (ii) a submission-critical evaluation checklist covering leakage, regime shift, transaction costs, and market impact, and (iii) an actionable frontier agenda that highlights near-term, testable research problems.

To enhance reproducibility and practical adoption, the manuscript also provides a curated list of open datasets and reproducible benchmarks with links and access/licensing notes, enabling readers to rapidly align experiments with common baselines.

Author expertise and suitability (mandatory for Review Articles).
I am Zhang Yuchen (single author), affiliated with the AI, Ethics and Society Programme, Faculty of Arts, The University of Hong Kong. My academic training and research focus on machine learning systems and empirical evaluation, including robustness/generalization and reproducibility in applied ML settings. For this review, I conducted a systematic literature search and screening (2015–2026; initial retrieval ≈850 records; refined to a core set of 60 anchor papers), and report the selection process following PRISMA-style reporting for transparency.
