\section*{Highlights}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.6em, itemsep=0.6em]

\item We release ML Trading Bench, a one-command reproducible benchmark for ML-based quantitative trading on 50 US ETFs (2005--2024), producing 9 tables and 9 figures in under 6 minutes.

\item Walk-forward splitting with embargo, rolling normalisation, and a configurable cost model are integrated to prevent the most common evaluation pitfalls that inflate reported performance.

\item All bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals on gross Sharpe ratios include zero; at 15\,bps cost, every long-short strategy turns deeply negative---demonstrating the severity of the ``alpha cliff.''

\item After Benjamini--Hochberg FDR correction on 66 pairwise Diebold--Mariano tests, no ML-vs-ML pair is statistically distinguishable.

\item Strategy hyperparameters (rebalance frequency, portfolio concentration) shift Sharpe by $>$0.5---often exceeding model-choice effects---and regime decomposition reveals that COVID-era volatility drives most headline results.

\end{itemize}
